<div class="para"> If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don’t have write access (aka push access), you can <dfn class="terminology">fork</dfn> the project. When you “fork” a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours; it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.</div>
<div class="para">In GitHub, a “fork” is simply a copy of the project in your own namespace, allowing you to make changes to a project publicly as a way to contribute in an open manner. Note: Historically, the term “fork” has sometimes had a negative connotation if it meant that someone took an open source project in a different direction, creating a competing project and splitting the contributors.</div>
<div class="para">This way, projects don’t have to worry about adding users as collaborators to give them push access. People can fork a project, push to it, and contribute their changes back to the original repository by creating a merge request which in GitHub is called a <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn>. We’ll cover this next. Making a pull request opens up a discussion thread with code review, and the owner and the contributor can then communicate about the change until the owner is happy with it, at which point the owner can merge it in.</div>
<div class="para">To fork a project, visit the project page and click the “Fork” button at the top-right of the page. This gives you a copy of the project in the GitHub cloud.</div>
<div class="para">Once you have your own fork on GitHub, you need to <dfn class="terminology">clone</dfn> a local copy down to a place where you can edit it, most typically your own local computer. <em class="emphasis">Note that while you can make small changes in GitHub, it is not a good practice to do so.</em>
