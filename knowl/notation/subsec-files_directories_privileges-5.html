<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Introduction to Shell Commands.</span></h4>
<div class="para"></div>
<div class="para">Shell commands are simply commands that are typed into the shell. As our very first shell command to try, let’s try the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command which simply echos or displays the argument(s) to the terminal.  Try the following with or without the quotes:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo "I love open source!"
</pre>
<div class="para">You should have seen the text "I love open source!" printed in the terminal. Now if that were all the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command could do, it would be a fairly pointless command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command’s real power is in displaying the contents of variables and files as we will soon see.</div>
<div class="para">The shell is designed to work in an OS which is a multi-user environment. Type in the following command to see your username:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">whoami
</pre>
<div class="para">The shell should respond with the username that you created when you set up your system.  For me that is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>.</div>
<div class="para">Note that your environment might be <dfn class="terminology">case sensitive</dfn>, which means that it might discriminate between uppercase and lowercase letters, where two words that in letter cases only, are not considered equal. This means that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Echo</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ECHO</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WhoAmI</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WHOAMI</code>  might not be recognized as commands, so you are in a case-sensitive environment and accidentally type one of these, you will elicit a response like:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'WhoAmI' not found
</pre>
<div class="para">or if you are in a case-sensitive environment and you are lucky, you might get something more helpful like:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'Echo' not found, did you mean:
    command 'echo'
</pre>
<div class="para">Sometimes it is helpful to be able to remember some information or look up previously stored information. This can be accomplished using environment variables. An <dfn class="terminology">environment variable</dfn> is a value that contains information about the system environment or the currently logged-in user. Having environment variables is a way of keeping track of information about the system environment and serves as a way to pass information about the environment to programs. For example, the operating system sets a bunch of environment variables which store information about the environment. As just one example, you might wonder how the operating system keeps track of its users. For each user, there is a user environment variable called USER that is specific only to the currently logged-in user. The shell will expand environment variables and that `echo` is useful to show us the results of that, so the USER environment variable can be accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command that we already saw.  Try the following:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $USER
</pre>
<div class="para">You should see the same result as you saw with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">whoami</code> command! Note that you must precede the variable name with a dollar sign $ whenever you reference the value it contains. Isn’t it interesting to peek inside the environment variable in that way? </div>
<div class="para">In fact, one of the key uses of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command is to echo the values of variables, which the shell can expand. Let’s see another example:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $SHELL
</pre>
<div class="para">You will likely see something like the following printed:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/bin/bash
</pre>
<div class="para">The reason you see something like this is because the SHELL environment variable stores the location of the shell program. This location, called the <dfn class="terminology">file path</dfn>, is given in the form of the path needed to find the location. We explore how this path is described in the next section.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#subsec-files_directories_privileges-5">in-context</a></span>
