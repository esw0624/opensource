<div class="para"></div>
<div class="para">Before computers became popular, a <dfn class="terminology">file</dfn> and a <dfn class="terminology">folder</dfn> referred to a container for a collection of documents. Operating systems use these terms very similarly. A file refers to a document and a folder or, synonymously, a <dfn class="terminology">directory</dfn> refers to a collection of files and sub-directories. The operating system handles how files and directories are represented on a physical storage medium, how they are read from, and written to. You may be most familiar with accessing files through a graphical user interface. Creating a new document corresponds to creating a new file. Often, when opening an application that deals with documents, it will suggest documents you have recently worked with. These each correspond to a file, each of which is stored in a directory somewhere, and knowing where files are in your file directory will be important to working on open source.</div>
<div class="para">You might (or might not) be familiar with using folders to organize our files and to navigate the file system. (On an iphone or Android phone, you make a new folder by dropping one app on top of another app, on a Mac you long press and then choose new folder, and on a Windows machine, you right-click and choose New &gt; folder.) This type of organization is important to understand, and the folder metaphor is useful. In fact, there are two useful metaphors to help with our understanding of file systems.</div>
<div class="para">When using the shell,  "folders" are more typically called "directories", but the two terms are equivalent.</div>
<div class="para">Inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Since directories may contain other directories in addition to files, the directories on your computer form a hierarchy. Each directory is contained within another directory, which we refer to as its <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn>. The only exception to this rule is the  <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>, which can be a parent to other directories, but has no parent itself. It is therefore the top-level directory from which we can reach any other directory. Each file and directory in the file system can be referred to by its unique <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>. The root directory always has the path <dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>, and a file can thus be identified by its path through the file system beginning from the root node. If there is a folder named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> located in the root directory, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> then contains a file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/hello.txt</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code> contains a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/mydocuments</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/mydocuments</code>. And so on." </div>
<div class="para">Note that the term <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> shouldn’t be confused with the term <em class="emphasis">root user</em> in a Linux-like system. The <dfn class="terminology">root user</dfn> is a user named <em class="emphasis">root</em>, which is a special superuser account in Linux operating systems that has unrestricted read and write privileges to everything. The <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> should also not be confused with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/root</code> folder which is found on some Linux-based systems and which is the home directory of the root superuser.</div>
<div class="para">Let’s get our bearings and see which directory we are currently in. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code> command stands for <em class="emphasis">print working directory</em> and as the name says it prints the path of the directory you are working in. Try typing:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">pwd
</pre>
<div class="para">When I type this, I see the following (but you will likely see a different path):</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/home/pearcej
</pre>
<div class="para">Reading the path from right to left, using the folder metaphor, this means I am in a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> which itself is a inside of a directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> which is itself inside of the root directory, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>. Note that the position with respect to the forward slash <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> tells us the direction of the relationship – further to the right is further inside.  To use the tree terminology, a directory that has a file or second directory directly inside of it is called a <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn> of the file or second directory that is inside, while the file or second directory is called the <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> of the parent directory. Hence, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>  is a child of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> is a child of the root directory <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> in our example.</div>
<div class="para">Let’s try "moving" (i.e. changing our working directory) to the root directory. Use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> command which stands for <em class="emphasis">change directory</em> followed by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd /
</pre>
<div class="para">This should transport you to the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn> (if you weren’t there already.) Now when you use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code>, you should see <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> echoed back.</div>
<div class="para">Next type the following <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> to get a <em class="emphasis">listing</em> of the files and subdirectories in the <em class="emphasis">current working directory</em>.</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls
</pre>
<div class="para">You should see a listing of files and directories.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#subsec-files_directories_privileges-6">in-context</a></span>
